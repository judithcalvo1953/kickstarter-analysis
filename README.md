# kickstarter-analysis
An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
This is an analysis to guide data driven decisions on campaign goalsetting.
### Challenge
The new analysis provides a tabular and visual presentation of the data based on categorization of the goal amount into several distinct groups of increased goal amounts.  Additionally, there is a pivot table and visualization that shows the association between month of launch date and the number of successful, failed and canceled Kickstarter projects.  This analysis provides the recipient with two specific factors that may affect the project outcome--the dollar amount proposed as a goal and the month of the year when the campaign is launched.  Both factors are important considerations driving the project director's decisions on when to embark on a kickstarter project and how much to aim for in terms of a budget.
